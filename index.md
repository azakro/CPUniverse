A Google Cardboard learning experience.

### Problem Statement
Lecturing is the most common form of teaching in education but its effectiveness to help students learn and grasp material is questionable. Research suggests that approximately “60% of students find at least half their lectures boring - with about 30% claiming to find most or all of their lectures boring.” In order to combat the negative effects of lecture-style teaching methods, virtual reality (VR) technology can be utilized to enhance the learning experience of students and engage them to learn more material. CPUniverse is a VR-based learning application that simulates the journey of what happens when a computer mouse is clicked. The simulation explains how different parts of the computer interact with one another and takes the user through each of the intermediate steps, providing a perspective that cannot be emulated in real life.
